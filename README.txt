Software Engineering Lab Internal - Answer Key (Sets 1, 2 & 3)
Set 1: Campus Event Management System
QI. Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
a. Abstract
The Campus Event Management System is a centralized web-based platform designed to streamline the planning, promotion, and execution of events within a college campus. The system will provide an integrated solution for event organizers to create and manage events, for students and faculty to register and receive notifications, and for administrators to monitor and manage all campus activities. The primary goal is to enhance communication, improve event attendance, and increase overall efficiency by automating registration, scheduling, and attendance tracking.
________________________________________
b. Functional Requirements
1.	User Authentication: Users (Students, Admins) must be able to register and log in to the system securely.
2.	Event Creation: Administrators and designated event organizers must be able to create new events with details like title, description, date, time, and location.
3.	Event Registration: Students and faculty must be able to browse a list of upcoming events and register for them.
4.	Notifications: The system shall send automated email or in-app notifications to registered users about upcoming events and any changes to the schedule.
5.	Attendance Tracking: Event organizers must be able to mark the attendance of participants for each event.
________________________________________
c. Non-Functional Requirements
1.	Performance: The system should load any page within 3 seconds and handle at least 100 concurrent user sessions without a noticeable drop in performance.
2.	Security: All user data, especially passwords, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest. The system should be protected against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
3.	Usability: The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate, requiring minimal training for a new user to register for an event.
4.	Availability: The system must be available 99.5% of the time, excluding planned maintenance windows.
________________________________________
d. Identification of Users
1.	Students: The primary users who will browse events, register for them, and view their schedule.
2.	Event Organizers / Faculty: Users who have permissions to create, update, and manage specific events. They can also view registrant lists and track attendance.
3.	System Administrator: A privileged user responsible for managing user accounts, overseeing all events, and maintaining the system's overall health.
________________________________________
QII. Maven Java Application Development
1.	Download the repository and list files:
First, you clone the repository from GitHub. Then, you can list the files.
Bash
git clone https://github.com/kumbhambhargavi75/CampusMgmtSystem/
cd CampusMgmtSystem
ls -R
2.	Resolve "Source option 1.7 is no longer supported" error:
This error occurs because the version of Java you are using to run Maven is newer than the version specified in the pom.xml. To fix it, you need to update the Java version property in your pom.xml.
Solution: Change the compiler source and target properties to a supported version like 1.8 (Java 8) or 11.
XML
<properties>
  <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
  <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
  <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
3.	Upgrade JUnit from 3.8.1:
To use modern Java features and testing annotations (@Test), you should upgrade JUnit.
Solution: Update the JUnit dependency in your pom.xml to a more recent version, like 4.13.2.
XML
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.13.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
4.	What happens if the <version> tag is missing?
If the <version> tag is omitted from a dependency, Maven cannot determine which version of the library to download. This will cause the build to fail with an error like "'dependencies.dependency.version' for [dependency] is missing." Maven needs an explicit version to ensure a deterministic and reproducible build.
5.	Misspelled <artifactId>cms</artifactId> in a dependency:
If you misspell an <artifactId>, Maven will not be able to find the specified library in the remote repositories (like Maven Central). This will result in a build failure with an error message indicating that the dependency could not be resolved or found.
To ensure a proper version is used, you must first correct the <artifactId> to its proper value and then specify the desired version explicitly in the <version> tag.
6.	Error from <paking> tag:
The tag <paking> is a typo. The correct tag name is <packaging>.
Error Thrown: Maven will fail during the validation phase of the build lifecycle, throwing an error like "Unrecognised tag: 'paking'" or "Project descriptor is invalid."
Debugging: To debug such XML mistakes, you can carefully proofread the pom.xml file, use an IDE with Maven support, or run mvn validate.
7.	Impact of default packaging (jar):
If you omit the <packaging> tag, Maven defaults to jar. The impact is that mvn package will produce a .jar file instead of a .war file. A .jar file cannot be deployed on a web server like Tomcat.
8.	Add MySQL dependency:
XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.33</version>
</dependency>
9.	How can I add the JQuery dependency?
You can manage it using Maven via WebJars.
XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>jquery</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.4</version>
</dependency>
10.	Correcting <artifactId>:
An incorrect <artifactId> will cause the generated JAR/WAR file to have the wrong name. This can cause issues in deployment scripts that expect a specific filename. To fix it, you simply correct the spelling inside the <artifactId>...</artifactId> tags in the pom.xml.
11.	& 12. Change build output directory:
To change the default build output directory from target/ to build_output/, you add a <directory> tag inside the <build> section of your pom.xml.
XML
<build>
  <finalName>CampusMgmtSystem</finalName>
  <directory>${project.basedir}/build_output</directory>
</build>
12.	Add JUnit 4.13-beta-2 dependency:
XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.13-beta-2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
13.	Save, Run, and Push updated pom.xml:
Bash
mvn clean install
git add pom.xml
git commit -m "feat: Update pom.xml with correct dependencies and settings"
git push origin main
________________________________________
QIII. Git & GitHub Integration with Maven Project
1.	Start tracking the project:
Bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
2.	Create a snapshot with a message:
Bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added event registration feature"

# ... make changes and commits ...
git checkout main
git merge feedback
9.	Resolve a merge conflict:
When git merge reports a conflict:
1.	Open the conflicted file(s) and look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
2.	Edit the file to remove the markers and keep the correct code.
3.	Stage the resolved file: git add <conflicted-file-name>.
4.	Commit the merge: git commit.
10.	Collaborate using Fork-and-Pull-Request workflow:
1.	Fork: Click the "Fork" button on the original GitHub repository.
2.	Clone: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3.	Branch: Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b my-new-feature.

Set 2: Food Ordering System
QI. Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
a. Abstract
The Cafeteria Food Ordering System is a modern, web-based application designed to digitize and streamline the food ordering process for students and faculty on campus. The system provides an intuitive interface for browsing the cafeteria menu, placing orders, and making secure digital payments. It offers real-time order status updates for customers and a comprehensive dashboard for administrators to manage menu items, pricing, and orders. The primary objective is to enhance user convenience, reduce wait times, and improve the operational efficiency of the cafeteria.
________________________________________
b. Functional Requirements
1.	User Authentication: Users (Students, Staff, Admin) must be able to create an account, log in, and log out.
2.	Menu Management: Administrators must be able to add, update, delete, and categorize food items on the menu.
3.	Order Placement: Customers must be able to browse the menu, add items to a cart, and place an order.
4.	Payment Gateway: The system must integrate with a digital payment gateway to process online payments.
5.	Order Tracking: Customers must be able to view the real-time status of their order.
________________________________________
c. Non-Functional Requirements
1.	Performance: The system must load the menu and process an order within 3 seconds.
2.	Security: All payment transactions must be encrypted using SSL/TLS.
3.	Usability: The interface should be simple and self-explanatory.
4.	Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.8%.
________________________________________
d. Identification of Users
1.	Customer (Student/Faculty): The primary user who browses the menu and places orders.
2.	Administrator (Cafeteria Staff): A privileged user who manages the menu and views incoming orders.
________________________________________
QII. Maven Web Application Development
1.	Artifact name with <finalName>Food-System</finalName>:
o	Generated Artifact: Food-System.war.
o	Deployment Issues: Tomcat will use the filename as the application's context path, so the URL would be http://localhost:8080/Food-System/. This can cause "404 Not Found" errors if developers expect a different URL.
2.	Download the repository and list files:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/kumbhambhargavi75/FoodSystem/
cd FoodSystem
ls -R
3.	JUnit version is left out:
o	What Maven will do: The build will fail because Maven requires an explicit version for every dependency.
o	How to ensure a proper version: You must explicitly add the <version> tag inside the <dependency> block.
4.	Misspelled <artifactId>:
o	Error: The build will fail with a "Could not resolve dependencies" error because Maven can't find the library.
o	Debugging: Check the pom.xml for typos or run mvn dependency:tree.
5.	Impact of omitting <packaging> tag:
Maven will default to jar packaging, creating a .jar file instead of a .war. This .jar file cannot be deployed on a Tomcat server.
6.	Correcting the MySQL dependency:
The provided XML snippet has misspelled tags: <groupdId> should be <groupId> and <artifactd> should be <artifactId>.
o	Correct Coordinates:
XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.28</version>
</dependency>
7.	Missing information in tomcat7-maven-plugin:
The plugin configuration is likely missing a specific <version> for the plugin itself and a <configuration> block with a defined <path> for the application's context URL.
8.	The <url> tag:
o	Mistake: The snippet url>...</url> is missing the opening angle bracket (<).
o	Purpose: The <url> element in a pom.xml is purely informational. It provides a link to the project's website and has no effect on the build process.
9.	Removing <contextPath> from the Tomcat plugin:
Without <contextPath>, the application's context path will default to the project's <artifactId>, which might not be the desired URL.
10.	Deployment URL .../FoodSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:
o	Output: The homepage of your web application.
o	Why: Tomcat uses the name of the WAR file (<artifactId>-<version>.war) as the default context path.
11.	Effect of <finalName>FoodOrder</finalName>:
o	WAR Name: FoodOrder.war.
o	Deployment URL: http://localhost:8080/FoodOrder/.
12.	Meaning of SNAPSHOT version:
o	Meaning: A SNAPSHOT version indicates an unstable version currently in active development.
o	Impact: Maven will always check for the latest SNAPSHOT build from the remote repository, which can lead to non-reproducible builds.
13.	Applying a patch file with Git:
o	Git Command: git apply path/to/the/css-fix.patch
o	Ensuring it becomes part of commits: After applying and testing, you must stage and commit the changes:
Bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Apply CSS fix from teammate"
________________________________________
QIII. Git & GitHub Integration
1.	Initialize a Git repository: git init
2.	Set global user name and email:
Bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
3.	Stage, commit, and connect to GitHub:
Bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-github-repository-url>
git push -u origin main
4.	Stage a specific file and a folder: git add pom.xml src/main/java
5.	git reset vs. git rm --cached:
o	git reset HEAD <file>: Unstages a file, leaving it in your working directory as a modified file.
o	git rm --cached <file>: Unstages the file AND tells Git to stop tracking it completely.
6.	Save changes without committing: git stash
7.	Remove a wrongly staged file (temp.txt) from staging: git reset HEAD temp.txt
8.	Stash changes with a descriptive message: git stash save "WIP: Implementing user login"
9.	Merge a feature branch into main:
Bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/reviews
10.	Copy a project to a teammate's local machine: git clone <repository_url>
11.	Push a new local branch to GitHub: git push -u origin feature/real-time-status
12.	Connect to GitHub using SSH:
1.	Generate an SSH key pair: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
2.	Add the public key to GitHub: Copy the contents of your public key file (e.g., ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) and add it to your GitHub account settings.
________________________________________
QIV. Docker containerization
1.	Pull nginx:latest from Docker Hub: docker pull nginx:latest
2.	Run nginx in a detached container with port mapping: docker run -d --name web-nginx -p 8090:80 nginx:latest
3.	Stop a container consuming high CPU: docker stop <container_name_or_id>
4.	Stop and remove a running container: docker rm -f <container_name_or_id>
5.	Run a Redis container with port mapping: docker run -d -p 8080:6379 redis
6.	List running containers: docker ps
7.	Pull and run python and list running containers:
Bash
docker pull python
docker run -dit python
docker ps
8.	Handle a port conflict on 8080: The error "port is already allocated" means another process is using it. Solve it by stopping the other process or running your container on a different host port (e.g., -p 8081:8080).
9.	Update configuration and rebuild/rerun:
1.	Stop and remove the old container: docker rm -f <old_container_name>.
2.	Update your source code.
3.	Rebuild the Docker image: docker build -t your-app:v2 .
4.	Rerun the container with the new image and port: docker run -d -p 8090:8080 your-app:v2.
10.	Stop and start a running container: docker stop <container> and docker start <container>
11.	Check container status: docker ps -a (to see status), docker logs <container> (to see application output).
